#Â Terraform scripts for a HA etcd Cluster
# Currently being changed with SSL fixes
### This script creates:

- 3 x t2.micro CoreOS EC2 instances - etcd servers - private subnet
- 1 x t2.micro CoreOS EC2 instances - bastion (etcd proxy) - public subnet
- A VPC that spans 2 AZs.
- 4 Subnets (2 private, 2 public. 1 of each per AZ) - the etcd instances = private subnets, etcd proxy = public
- An autoscaling group and launch configuration.
- Launch config utlizes EC2 userdata template
- EC2 userdata = cloud-init + etcd discovery via Monsanto method (referenced below)
- EC2 security groups, egress = all traffic, ingress locked internally to VPC and variable "myip" (default == 0.0.0.0/0 in tfvars)
- An IAM role for the etcd instances.

### To use:

Pre-requisites: Terraform, AWS CLI and SSH Keys

```
1. Modify terraform.tfvars as you wish
2. terraform get && terraform plan
3. terraform apply
```

### To check if its function correctly:

```
1. SSH into the bastion
2. Run "etcdctl cluster-health"
3. If 3 nodes show as healthy, you're good to go, else destroy and retry
```


### Extra steps:

Change "myip" in tfvars to your ip to lockdown public instance IPs

Change etcd cluster size by modifying terraform.tfvars: 
- asg_number_of_instances = "3"
- asg_minimum_number_of_instances = "3"

Note: cluster size must be an odd number

###Version info:

 Working and Tested as of 10/01/17
 Terraform version: 0.8.3

### Features to implement in the future:

Integrate with Kubernetes - Terraform scripts

TLS certs - already underway

Improve documentation
